Install Ruby if not installed.
Create a new Ruby file with a .rb extension. Example: index.rb
Call the created file in the console using ruby
Open the created file with any favorite editor
Write a few lines and comment on them
Add to the output file of the basic 'edge' literals (Fixnum, Float, String)
Declare multiple variables with readable names and display these variables (can also be Fixnum, Float, String)
Try to declare variables with invalid names, run the file (item 5), comment out the lines that cause exceptions (errors)
Declare the expression of type total = a + b with the transfer of the second operand to a new line, and make sure that Ruby continues to build the expression if at the end of the line finds any operator
Declare an expression of type total = a + b with the second operand with the operator on a new line, and make sure that Ruby ignores the next line if it sees the completed expression
total = a + b Move + b to a new line using the special operator '\', and make sure that Ruby interprets two expressions in two lines as one expression
Write an expression in which to divide two integers (for example 5 and 2, or 7 and 3), but such two numbers, the division of which would give the remainder, get the wrong answer
Rewrite the expression with division so that the result was correct.
Try dividing any numeric value by 0 (get error)
Divide the fractional number by 0
Write an expression using the "remainder of division" operator
Declare a variable, and elevate it to a power using the exponentiation operator
Declare a string literal in single quotes
Declare a string literal in single quotes using the characters you want to screen
Declare a string literal with interpolation
Declare a long string literal by moving it to a new line using the "\" symbol
Declare a string literal using string modifiers%,% q% Q.
Interpolate any variable in the string declared with% Q
Declare two lines and add them
Try adding an integer value to the string.
Declare two identical lines and compare them.
Declare a string and duplicate it n times with the "*" character
Declare a string and add any text to it using the "<<" operator
Declare the string 'I love Ruby' using the '[]' method to get the 'R' character and the 'I' character in two ways.
Declare the string 'Ruby' using the method "[]" to get the value nil
Declare the string 'Hello Ruby' and using the operator "[]" passing the substring 'Ruby', in two ways
Declare the line 'Ruby is awesome' and remove 'is' from it. The result should be a string 'Ruby awesome'
Declare the string 'RUBY' and convert it to 'ruby' using the method. (You need to find the necessary method yourself)
Declare the line 'Ruby courses', and using the method, print the number of characters in the line.
Declare the string 'Ruby' using the required method to print the string 'ybuR'
